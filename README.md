# Boston-House-Price-Prediction
The problem that we are going to solve here is that given a set of features that describe a house in Boston, our machine learning model must predict the house price. To train our machine learning model with boston housing data, we will be using scikit-learnâ€™s boston dataset.  In this dataset, each row describes a boston town or suburb. There are 506 rows and 13 attributes (features) with a target column (price).  CRIM per capita crime rate by town ZN proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft. INDUS proportion of non-retail business acres per town CHAS Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise) NOX nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million) RM average number of rooms per dwelling AGE proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940 DIS weighted distances to five Boston employment centres RAD index of accessibility to radial highways TAX full-value property-tax rate per 10,000usd PTRATIO pupil-teacher ratio by town B 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town LSTAT % lower status of the population  Each record in the database describes a Boston suburb or town.
